Business Activities:

In the 2000s the world was highly dependent on high interest credit cards to process online shopping transactions. High interest rates tend to leave many consumers debt-laden and remove these consumers from markets completely. Klarna helps customers deal with the inability to repay. In case a customer is unable to the pay their instalment amount on time, Klarna assumes liability and helps with an alternative repayment solution and guides the consumer to manage their money better. This model is rapidly growing because it allows people to consume more from retailers without the burden of high interest rates, thus benefiting both consumer and retailer.

Recommendations

* If you were to advise the company, what products or services would you suggest they offer? (This could be something that a competitor offers, or use your imagination!)

Since Klarna already offers an online mall for merchants they could potentially merge a reselling platform for consumers to trade used items with payment solutions too. An application named Poshmark already exists as an e-commerce website and app where users can buy and sell used clothing and accessories. Poshmark does not offer payment solutions although many items are between $100-1000. 

* Why do you think that offering this product or service would benefit the company?

Merging a reselling service with the Klarna app will increase Klarna’s daily transactions and number of users. Allowing their consumers to check for desired items under a used column and a new column will promote sustainability in this destructive era of fast fashion. Poshmark primarily operates with credit card services as payment options. Klarna could offer this social shopping service to more people and help them avoid racking up credit card debt while simultaneously skyrocketing their sales.  

* What technologies would this additional product or service utilize?

Klarna would need to use their data collection for personalization technology, it would require a variety of software tools that collect, store, and manage customer data to orchestrate a seamless experience based on their financial needs i.e., would they prefer used or new items?

* Why are these technologies appropriate for your solution?

Klarna already collects data from relational databases, cloud data sources, message queues, Kafka etc. Since they already source information to personalize experiences, they can offer a better service than Poshmark from start to finish. They can personalize sizing, color preferences, and payment preferences, making them to most desired shopping forum in the digital world.
